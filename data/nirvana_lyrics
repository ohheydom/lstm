If you wouldn't mind I would like to blew
If you wouldn't mind I would like to loose
If you wouldn't care I would like to leave
If you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stain
Could you believe who we knew was stress or strain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

If you wouldn't mind I would like to blew

Here is another word that rhymes with shame

You could do anything

Bell on door clanks - come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down (in the) chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face

I'm ashamed

Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-Pee pressed against my lips

I was shamed

I sense others in the room
Opie Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered in Andy's clutch

I was shamed

I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, won't you have a clue?

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

I do

I'm standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number, too
I do keep a date with you

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

I do

I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, won't you have a clue?

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No, I can't see you every night
Free

I do
Won't you believe it
It's just my luck

No recess

Won't you believe it
It's just my luck

No recess

You're in high school again

No recess

Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems

Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz!!!

Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems

Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz?
Can you feel my love buzz!!!


When I'm feeling tired
She pushed food through the door
And I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way

Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
- a good hosing down

The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twitch and masturbate!

I said so
Nirvana

Black windows of paint
I scratched with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?

They bring out the older ones
They point in my way
They come with a flash of light
And take my family away

And very later I have learned
To accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you!

To take
Me with
You're right

Nirvana

In my eyes, I'm not lazy
In my face, It's not over
In your room, I'm not older
In your eyes, I'm not worth it
Gimme back my alcohol [x7]

Heal a million, kill a million

d a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show

Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart 
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your might and wisdom
Yes I eat cow - I am not proud

Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and keep it clean
Yes I eat cow - I am not proud

Is he in an easychair?
Oversized rock
I don't like you anyway
Seal it in a box

Hold me down in restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is the whole fleece shun in master?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am, I know I can
Make enough of the words as you go along, I sing then some

Sickening pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God for putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!

Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend

Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

It isn't me
We have some seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
I want some help
To please myself
I've got some rope
You have been told
I promise you
I have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
I want some help
To please myself

Maybe she would like some food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

And she's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
It amazes me, the will of instinct

"Come on people now, smile on your brother and
everybody get together, try to love one another right now"

When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait

Never met a wise man, if so it's a woman

[x2]
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait

"Just because you're paranoid, don't mean they're not after you"

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here
Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait


One baby to another says -
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think
Unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube
And end up in your infection

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

With eyes so dilated
I've become your pupil
You've taught me everything
Without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful -
Vacuum out the fluids

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you
You
You
You
You
You

Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins

I'm like you

Truth - covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to, but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
I still smell her on you

Don't - tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield

Who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We've made a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without new rules
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still

Still smell her on you [x3]

Monkey see, monkey do

Give an inch, take a smile
I don't know why - fashion shits, fashion style

God is gay! 

I'll start this off without any words
I got so high that I scratched 'till I bled

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

The finest day that I ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream of memory restored (Alt: In a dream my memory has stored)
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, then I can go home

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

[x5]
I'm on a plain
I can't complain

I kicked and screamed, said please, don't go

Grandma take me home [x8]

Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good

Never take me home [x8] (Alt: Grandma take me home [x8])

Go outside and ride your bike
Thats what I did, I killed my toad

Never take me home [x8]

After dinner, I had ice cream

I woke up in my mother's arms

Never take me home [x19]
I wanna be alone

Take a step outside yourself
And you turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary
So silly
It's Revolting
You're not much
You can't do anything

Take a step outside the city
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is revolting
You're really nowhere
So wasteful
So foolish
Poppycock!

Who said don't look back?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that crazy sounding restaurant
'Cause they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let them do it
You know what I'm talking about?
You hear me talking?
You hear me talking!?

It's pretty scary, it's so revolting [x4]
Naaaah !

Take a step outside the country
And you turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is amazing
Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's a laugh

Take a step outside the planet
Turn around and around
Take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary

She said
She'd take me anywhere
She'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me

She said
She'd take me anywhere
She'd take me anywhere
As long as I stayed clean

Kiss kiss Molly's lips [x4 and x8 in the end]


Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout
And over again
Gun gun son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference what I say

[x2]
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout

Why doesn't she need him for a father?
Not only maidens can occupy my shack
Goring my manhood turns a man off
Like Pepe LePew would say,
Hey, hey, hey! -- and then we clash!

I got my diddly spayed [x3]
I got my diddly

She laughs about it
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right
Jacking themselves off polyester
I wanna jump, this isn't right!
Hey, when am I getting it back?

I got my diddly spayed [x3]
I got my diddly

I don't know why,
I've got a joke too silly to say
Don't touch the balls
I got a dick, Dick -- hear my fucking hate!

I got my diddly spayed [x3]
I got my diddly

If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly
Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate
Feeling can't help me romp

Bill just fuck me, take me anal
Billy's slit reminds me of someone
I'm sick of paying for the love boat
Tony and Tenille say wanna jump rope
And I say look!

I got my penis spayed,
I got a little tail,
I got my dingaling spayed
I got my dingaling spayed
I gotta be around pussy
Don't let me fall
I got a heh-heh ... well you can't live

We got my dingaling spayed [x6]
I got my dingaling spayed [x5]
I got my diddly

All the itchy flakes, it is a flaming
All the gels and cremes it is pertaining
To a fungus mold cured by injection
Hope it's only ah, a yeast infection

Oh well, it burns when I - it hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I - it hurts when I see

Now I vomit cum and diarrhoea
On the tile floor like oatmeal pizza
Fill my toilet bowl full of a cloudy
Puss, I feel the blood becoming chowder rust

Oh well, it burns when I - it hurts when I pee
Oh well, it hurts when I - it hurts when I see

Roll into my bed which does consist of
Lice, bugs and fleas and yellow mucus
Stained dirt, vaseline, toe jam and booger
Stomach acid worms that dance in sugared sludge

Mmmmm ... 


I was your mind, you were my, my enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You would mind, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was was your en ... aaahh

You rang
Your ears rang

I was your mind, you were my, my enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You would mind, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was was your ena ... aaahh

At night, the wishful goddess
At night, she'll wish the hardest
At night, the disco goddess
At night, the witch go gaaahhh!

I was your mind, you were my, my enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You would mind, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was was your ena ...

Wishful goddess, at night
Wish the hardest, at night
Wishful goddess, at night
Wishful gaaahhh!

I was your mind, you were my, my enemy,
You were mine, I was your, your enemy,
You would mind, I was your, your enemy,
You were mine, I was was your ena!

At night, the wishful goddess
At night, she'll wish the hardest
At night, the disco goddess
At night, the itch so modest
At night, the crisco lochness
At night, a mouthful omelette
At sight, the fish full goblets
At night, the witch go gaaawd !!

What's a season in a right if you can't have anything
What's the reason in a rhyme if a plan means anything
What's the meaning in a crime, it's a fan if anything
Where's the learning in a line, it's a brand, it's a brand

How a culture comes again, it was all here yesterday
And you swear it's not a trend, doesn't matter anyway
There's only here to talk to friends, nothing new is everyday
You could shit upon the stage, they'll be fans

They'll be fans [alt: If you brand] [x3]

[x2]
All the kids will eat it up, if it's packaged properly
Steal a sound and imitate, keep a format equally
Not an ode, just the facts, where our world is nowadays
An idea is what we lack, it doesn't matter anyways

Hey ... [x7]

It's not cold enough
Please put this side up
She is moving through
Can we show our faces now?

I'm not interesting
She's not turning green
Shameful as it seems
Can we show our faces now?

Endless climb
I am blind
Why can't I leave?
Color blind
Speaking a phrase
Instantly grown
I am blind
Waiting in line

It's not cold enough
Please put this side up
She is moving through
Can we show our faces now?

I'm not interesting
She's not turning green
Shameful as it seems
Can we show our faces now?

Endless climb
I am blind
Why can't I leave?
Color blind
Speaking a phrase
Instantly grown
I am blind

Why am I sure?

Come on over and do the twist
Over-do it and have a fit
Love you so much it makes me sick
Come on over and do the twist

Beat me outta me - Beat it! beat it! [x7]
Beat me outta me

Come on over and do the twist
Over-do it and have a fit
Love you so much it makes me sick
Come on over and shoot the shit

Beat me outta me - Beat it! beat it! [x7]
Beat me outta me

She keeps it pumpin' straight to my heart [x8]

Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold

If she floats than she is not
A witch like we had thought
A down payment on another
One at salem's lot

Serve the servants - Oh no [x4]

That legendary divorce is such a bore

As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead I had a dad

I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before

Serve the servants - Oh no [x4]

That legendary divorce is such a bore

Serve the servants - Oh no [x7]

That legendary divorce is such a bore 

Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice

Go away - get away, get a-way

Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers

Go away - get away, get a-way

I lie in the soll and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit!
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit

Go away - get away, get away, get away, get away, get away, get a-way

She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back [Alt: ... when you turn black]

Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait! [Alt: Hate! Haight!]
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel's hair and baby's breath
Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your Heart-Shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn back [Alt: ... when you turn black]

Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Hey! Wait!
I've got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Your advice [x3]


Rape me
Rape me my friend
Rape me
Rape me again

I'm not the only one [x4]

Hate me
Do it and do it again
Waste me
Rape me my friend

I'm not the only one [x4]

My favorite inside source
I'll kiss your open sores
Appreciate your concern
You'll always stink and burn

Rape me
Rape me my friend
Rape me
Rape me again

I'm not the only one [x4]

Rape me! [x9] 

It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking wherever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad [x3]

In her false witness, we hope you're still with us,
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience,
Disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars,
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground

I miss the comfort in being sad [x3]

It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To know that you're asking wherever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad [x3]

I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
The day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Or maybe just happy

Think I'm just happy [x3]

My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale
And mend it with you
We'll float around
And hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down
And have a hangover

Have a hangover [x3]

Skin the sun
Fall asleep
Wish away
The soul is cheap
Lesson learned
Wish me luck
Soothe the burn
Wake me up

I'm not like them
But I can pretend
The sun is gone
But I have a light
My day is done
But I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb
Maybe just happy

Think I'm just happy [x3]

I think I'm dumb [x12]

I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice

If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive
I've seen it all, I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive
I've seen it all, I was here first

[x2]
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphins

Doll steak!
Test meat!

Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping

I own my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit it is her milk

Test meat!
Doll steak!

Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping

Doll steak!
Test meat!

Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping

Protector of the kennel
Ecto-plasma, Ecto-skeletal
Obituary every birthday
Your scent is still here in my place of recovery! 

I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture

Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
I'm anemic royalty

Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

I'm so tired and I can't sleep
I'm anemic royalty
I'm a liar and a thief
I'm anemic royalty

I'm on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
I'm anemic royalty
I'm anemic royalty

- Hmmmmmm ... I just wanna know ... do you like me?

Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key

I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns

What is wrong with me [x3]

I'm gonna do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke

I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns

What is wrong with me [x2]
What do I think of me ?

Hate, hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth

What is wrong with me [x3]
What do I think of me ?

Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key

[x2]
What is wrong with me [x3]
What do I think of me ?

Mayday every day, in my heart.
Could've had a heart attack, in my heart.
We don't know anything, in my heart.
We all want something fair, in my heart.
Hey!
Hey!
Heyyyyyyy! [x3]

Out of town, out of sight, is my heart.
Queen of lies, everyday, in my heart.
My heart, one more on the phone, my heart.
One more at the phone, at my heart
Hey!
Hey!
Heyyyyyyyyyyy! [x2]

Mean heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart, cold heart, cold heart!

Uhhhhhhh!

What else should I be
All apologies
What else could I say
Everyone is gay
What else could I write
I don't have the right
What else should I be
All apologies

In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
I'm married
Buried

I wish I was like you
Easily amused
Find my nest of salt
Everything is my fault
I'll take all the blame
Aqua seafoam shame
Sunburn with freezeburn
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun
In the sun I feel as one
In the sun
In the sun
Married, Maried, Maried!
Buried!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

All in all is all we are [x20]

It hurts when you have to press that dull little thing
That you're only supposed to use once and then discard
Where do you put it? In the garbage can, my honest friend
My shyness, pet her flow

She's only been five months late, even though we haven't had sex for a week

A meal a day, a meal, I say
And my heart's made my ...

Somebody else already used the word 'aurora-borealis'
She was tied up in chains, and Sam had helped her in the freezer

She's only five weeks late, but I haven't had a date forever ...
Ever ... ever ... forever!

Wish I had more ... more opportunity,
More chances to remember some things
So I couldn't have so much pressure on my ...
On my ... on my, um ... ah, on my ... um ... um ... head

We'd have so much more diversity,
And so much more input, so much more creative flow,
If we had someone in school, a 'GIT' ...

GIT ... geeks ... in ... town.
Ha! ... Come on, Dave, think of one ... !
Girls with trouble
It should be GIC, geeks with charvels
No, GWC, fuck man this is a waste of time ...

[laughs]

One more solo? Yeahhhhhhhhh! Yeaaaahhhhh!

You're personally responsible for ...
The entire strip ... to be washed away ...
Cleansed ... as if gallons of, um, rubbing alcohol
Flowed through the strip and were set on fire.

It didn't just singe the hair, it made it straight.

And then Perry Ellis came along with his broom,
And his ... silk ...
And he ... he erected a beautiful city ...
A city of stars.
